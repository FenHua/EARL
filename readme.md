This repository provides a simple implementation of the work "Efficient Sparse Attacks on Videos using Reinforcement Learning"

**Example:**

![](example.jpg)

**Demo:**

Here, we provide 5 video clips in folder "dataset_numpy", you can run the following script and observe the effect:

```python
python un_attack_show.py   # untargeted attack
```

or

```python
python T_attack_show.py    # targeted attack
```

**Threat models:**

The video classification model, please refer to project https://github.com/FenHua/action-recognition

You can train the recognition model with your own data, and use the video attack method to attack them.
